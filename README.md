# Tourist Visit to Lumbini

This is my first attempt to create Shiny Application. I decided to create an interactive visualization to present number of tourists from different countries visiting Lumbini, Nepal in year 2012, 2013 and 2014. I have downloaded data provided by [Open Data Nepal](http://data.opennepal.net/content/number-foreigner-lumbini-2012-2013). This data file contains the information of number of tourists visiting Lumbini on year 2012, 2013, 2014.
